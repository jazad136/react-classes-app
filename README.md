# React version of Classes App

Saddler version of Classes App written with a React source code front end. 

This repository contains the frontend code for the Classes app, a webapp that helps course instructors host syllabi releases and your course descriptions. 

On the backend, you will be able to edit a JSON file, pull in all your descriptions into a database, and let it fly and have your updates be seen in a structured experience.
